# ICS 344: Information Security - Course Project

## Made by Dr Waleed A. Al-Gobi  Students

## Project Overview

This project provides a hands-on approach to learning key aspects of **offensive security**, **cyber deception**, and **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**. Students will:

1. Configure and compromise a vulnerable service.
2. Deploy and test honeypots to evaluate realism and behavior.
3. Use SIEM platforms to analyze and visualize security data.
4. Optionally, propose defensive strategies.

## Project Phases

### **Phase 1: Setup and Compromise**
- **Goal:** Configure a vulnerable service and use offensive tools to compromise it.
- **Tools & Frameworks:** 
  - MITRE Caldera
  - Kali Linux (e.g., Metasploit)
  - Custom scripts guided by MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- **Deadline:** November 5, 2024

### **Phase 2: Honeypot Setup and Evaluation**
- **Goal:** Deploy a honeypot that mimics the compromised service and compare its behavior.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Realism, attack time, and resource usage.
- **Deadline:** November 12, 2024

### **Phase 3: SIEM Analysis**
- **Goal:** Integrate logs from victim and honeypot environments into a SIEM platform for analysis and visualization.
- **Tools:** Wazuh, Splunk, ELK Stack, or Graylog.
- **Deadline:** November 20, 2024

### **Phase 4 (Optional): Defense Strategy Proposal**
- **Goal:** Propose and implement defense mechanisms using Caldera or custom scripts.
