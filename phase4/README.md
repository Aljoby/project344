# **SSH Honeypot Setup (Custom Implementation with Cowrie + Fail2Ban)**

This repository documents the **custom implementation of an SSH Honeypot** using **Fail2Ban**, **iptables redirection**, and **Cowrie SSH Honeypot**. While the entire setup was successfully implemented, this guide only covers the steps to **install and configure Cowrie**, making it easier for users without prior Cowrie experience to replicate the project.

## **Whatâ€™s Included in This Repository**
- Cowrie SSH Honeypot Installation and Configuration
- IP Banning and Redirection with Fail2Ban
- Email Notifications on Detected SSH Attacks
- Custom Credential Management in Cowrie
- IP Whitelisting and Blacklisting

## **Why Only Cowrie Setup?**
The entire project involved creating a **custom SSH Honeypot environment** with advanced features. Since **Cowrie** is a widely-used, highly configurable SSH honeypot, we decided to share **only its installation and configuration steps**. This allows users who **don't have Cowrie installed** to set it up easily and integrate it into their own custom implementations.
